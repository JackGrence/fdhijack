Usage:
(After gather chfd, fdhj.ko, fdhj_load in a directory)
	$ ./fdhj_load [fdhj_major=<major>]
	$ ./chfd <pid> <fd> <file> [keep mode: 0 | 1]
        Keep mode: Do not exit after change fds, this can provide the opportunity
                   to change back the fd afterward. If 1 is specified, press enter
				   to exchange the fds again; and enter exit to exit.

scr/fdhj_load is a script for loading the kernel module fdhj 
and create the corresponding device node /dev/fdhj 

fdhj_<platform> are the kernel modules for operating file
objects in kernel

src/libfdhj.c is the library for wrapping the fdhj module for applications

inc/ceh.h and src/ceh.c wrap setjmp() and longjmp() to be a
try...catch-style error handling framework in C

app/chfd is the user utility for changing a process's fd to
point to another existant file (device)

app/xchfd is not implemented yet

The major number for fdhj is dynamically allocated if not
specified on calling fdhj_load with the argument fdhj_major=<major>
