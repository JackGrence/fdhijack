app/chfd is the user-space utility by which we can use to manipulate a process's fd to point to another existant file (device).  
Usage:
(After gather chfd, fdhj.ko, fdhj_load in a directory)
	$ ./fdhj_load [fdhj_major=<major>]
	$ ./chfd <pid> <fd> <file> [keep mode: 0 | 1]
        Keep mode: Do not exit after change fds, this can provide the opportunity
                   to change back the fd afterward. If 1 is specified, press enter
				   to exchange the fds again; and enter exit to exit.

script/fdhj_load is a script for loading the kernel module fdhj, and create the corresponding device node /dev/fdhj.
The major number for fdhj is dynamically allocated if not specified on calling fdhj_load with the argument fdhj_major=<major>.

driver/fdhj_<kernel_version> are the kernel modules for operating file objects in kernel.

libfdhj is a library that wraps the fdhj module for user-space applications.

ceh wraps setjmp() and longjmp() to be a try...catch-style error handling framework in C.
